MetaDoom
========
A Doom mod that brings Doom into Doom. If... that makes sense.

This is the development repo - the versions you find here will be unstable and have even worse coding than the release versions. You should only be here if you're an awesome modder who knows what they're doing, or you're actively looking for bugs. Either way, there's probably something wrong with you.

Stable Releases and Actual Info

How to Build
------------
Run _main_zip.bat to quickly compile a PK3 or PK7 of the main mod.

Run _optional_zip.bat to quickly compile a PK3 or PK7 of the Optional Content.
