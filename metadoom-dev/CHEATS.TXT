Oh, come on. Like you need to cheat.

Yes, there are new cheats in MetaDoom, by way of the console. Nobody ever seemed
to notice the hints I gave about them (too subtle?) So I figure I'll just drop
them off here. Type these into the console to activate. Be warned: If you enter
an invalid number, you'll be killed instantly.

impulse 35 - Toggle Micro-Rocket Placeholder Mode
-------------------------------------------------
While active, this makes the Machinegun's alt-fire shoot Shotgun grenades instead
of micro-rockets. I used those as placeholders before I added the micro-rockets
themselves, and it seemed fun enough to not remove completely.

impulse 2004 - Enable Doom 3 Mode
---------------------------------
This drops all the sector lighting in the map to 0. Naturally. Useful for testing
GLDEFS and brightmaps and stuff, actually.

impulse 16 - Enable SNES Mode
-----------------------------
This stretches out all the floor and ceiling textures to look flat-shaded.

impulse 420 - Obvious Joke Mode
-------------------------------
Permanently enables the smoke effect from extinguishing yourself. I can't imagine
why, to be honest. It's a bit above my head.

I'll add more if I get some feedback or suggestions. Drop 'em off at the usual
addresses and I'll see what I can do!
