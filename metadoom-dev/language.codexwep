MC_MetaPistol_Desc = "One of the most recent of the UAC's military innovations, the EMG (Energy-Matter-Gel) Sidearm replaces the Berettas that had been traditionally used by security personnel with what amounts to an energy blaster, launching a hardened plasma gel at high velocities. In addition, so as to avoid another 'duct tape incident', the EMG Sidearm implements a small, lightweight flashlight under the barrel, which allows users to light their way and remain combat-ready at the same time.";

While it's primarily designed for close-range combat, security personnel have reported reasonable amounts of success using the weapon at medium and long ranges, peppering enemies from non-extreme distances. Recent upgrades have allowed the attachment of an underslung grenade launcher that's reasonably effective at dispersing close-knit groups.";

MC_MetaSuperShotgun_Desc = "Among the state-of-the-art, high-tech implements of deterrance that make up the UAC arsenal, the ''Super'' Shotgun is a curious anomaly, with very little to differentiate it from a traditional farmer's tool. While it's long been struck from the UAC's Approved Weapons List, many veteran security personnel insist on keeping theirs, and when you use it, it'll be easy to see why: a quick squeeze of the trigger effectively blankets the air in front of the user with a cloud of buckshot from both barrels.";

MC_MetaMachineGun_Desc = "The long-time standard issue weapon of the UAC's security forces, the Assault Rifle is at its core a traditional portable Machine Gun, peppering opponents with low-calibre bullets. It's effective, but it's believed that the next generation of the Plasma Rifle is planned to replace it. Alternate fire lets the user toggle a side-mounted rack of micro-missiles. While these are much more effective, they consume your ammunition much faster, and as such should be used sparingly.";

This technology continues to be flirted with by way of portable vulcan cannons, but finding people who can withstand carrying and firing the weapons is taking a lot longer than developing the technology... Alternate Fire converts the weapon into a stationary triple-barreled terror that can reduce any demon (as well as your ammo backpack) to confetti!";

Its origins weren't long-forgotten, though, and the tool was quickly re-repurposed. By hitting the alternate fire key, any rockets you have launched will be detonated in mid-air via radio signal, spraying the general vicinity with lethal shrapnel!";

While its projectiles are subject to gravity, they are fired out with far greater force, allowing canny Marines to safely destroy unsuspecting crowds from around corners.

MC_MetaPlasmaRifle_Desc = "The next generation of the UAC's standard-issue weaponry, the Plasma Rifle fires large blue blobs of energy at opponents at a frankly frightening rate. The only things stopping it from replacing the Assault Rifle are weight, the costs of Argent Energy batteries, and some dangerous heat-output issues that are still being addressed: As you fire the Plasma Rifle, a ''heat bar'' will build up. When the bar is full, hit Alternate Fire to expel this energy as a room-clearing 360-degree attack!";

This one failed in such a unique and interesting way that it was developed further, channeling plasma energy into a semi-predictable, short range stream of agony.  Alternate Fire launches an unstable ball of plasma energy that, upon impact, blossums into a searing mass of energy that effectively stuns enemies within the blast radius, leaving them easy pickings for other means of attack.";

Why some researcher decided to shove one into a children's toy is currently unknown, but the end results are surprisingly impressive.
