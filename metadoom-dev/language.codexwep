MC_MetaPistol_Desc = "One of the most recent of the UAC's military innovations, the EMG (Energy-Matter-Gel) Sidearm replaces the Berettas that had been traditionally used by security personnel with what amounts to an energy blaster, launching a hardened plasma gel at high velocities. These rounds move through the air slightly slower than traditional ballistic rounds, but this drawback is made up for with an Argent energy battery that allows for effectively unlimited ammo without any need to reload.";
MC_MetaPistol_Desc2 = "Due to the nature of the UAC's work, not all facilities are well-lit. In the past, this led security personnel to experiment with haphazard - and sometimes dangerous - improvised solutions with which to light the way and remain combat-ready at the same time. So as to avoid another 'duct tape incident', the EMG Sidearm implements a small, lightweight flashlight under the barrel, feeding off the same Argent battery as the rest of the weapon to reduce weight.";

MC_MetaShotgun_Desc = "The latest iteration of a popular weapon, the Combat Shotgun is designed to blast enemies with a spread of high-velocity buckshot. While it's primarily designed for close-range combat, security personnel have reported reasonable amounts of success using the weapon at medium and long ranges, peppering enemies from non-extreme distances.";
MC_MetaShotgun_Desc2 = "A recent redesign of the weapon using stronger, higher quality alloys has allowed the attachment of an underslung grenade launcher, emitting a concussive blast upon impact with any surface or object. While not as damaging as dedicated explosive weapons due to the smaller payload, it's none the less effective at dispersing close-knit groups of opponents.";

MC_MetaSuperShotgun_Icon = "MCDX_WSS";
MC_MetaSuperShotgun_Desc = "Among the state-of-the-art, high-tech implements of deterrance that make up the UAC arsenal, the 'Super' Shotgun is a curious anomaly, with very little to differentiate it from a traditional farmer's tool. While it's long been struck from the UAC's Approved Weapons List, many veteran security personnel insist on keeping theirs, and when you use it, it'll be easy to see why: a quick squeeze of the trigger effectively blankets the air in front of the user with a cloud of buckshot from both barrels.";
MC_MetaSuperShotgun_Desc2 = "While its far less effective outside of close range as its smaller brother, its extreme close range damage and ease of maintainence means that many marines refuse to use anything else, even when low on ammo and dealing with long-range targets. While such dedication is admirable, we fully recommend diversifying your arsenal for maximum effectiveness.";

MC_MetaMachineGun_Desc = "The long-time standard issue weapon of the UAC's security forces, the Assault Rifle is at its core a traditional portable Machine Gun, peppering opponents with low-calibur bullets. Its effective against single targets at all distances has earned it much-deserved longevity in the UAC arsenal, but it's believed that the next generation of the Plasma Rifle is planned to replace it.";

Today, centuries later, this technology continues to be flirted with by way of portable vulcan cannons, but finding people who can withstand carrying and firing the weapons for a prolonged period is taking a lot longer than developing the technology...";

Its origins weren't long-forgotten, though, and the tool was quickly re-repurposed and upgraded for life as a common sight in the hands of more heavily-armored UAC units.";
MC_MetaRocketLauncher_Desc2 = "This model contains a unique additional feature - by hitting the alternate fire key, any rockets you have launched will be detonated in mid-air via radio signal, allowing for greater damage and crowd control. Be warned, though - safety mechanisms are minimal...";

MC_MetaGrenadeLauncher_Desc = "A relatively new variant of the Rocket Launcher produced at the request of several senior Heavy Weapons personnel, the Grenade Launcher is comparatively lightweight. While its projectiles are subject to gravity and act similarly to traditional hand grenades, they are fired out with far greater force and are just as bouncy, allowing canny Marines to safely destroy unsuspecting crowds of enemies from around corners.";

MC_MetaPlasmaRifle_Desc = "The next generation of the UAC's standard-issue weaponry, the Plasma rifle fires large blue blobs of energy at opponents at a frankly frightning rate. The only thing stopping it from replacing the Assault Rifle are weight, the costs of supplying it with specially-made Argent Energy batteries, and some dangerous heat-output issues that are still being addressed in experimental and hazardous ways...";
MC_MetaPlasmaRifle_Desc2 = "As you fire the Plasma Rifle, a ''heat bar'' will build up on the device's screen, indicating dangerous gaseous buildup inside the weapon. When the bar is full, hit Alternate Fire to expel this energy as a powerful 360-degree attack - useful for clearing rooms!";

MC_MetaLightningGun_Desc = "During the development of the Plasma Rifle, a number of failed prototypes were produced. This one, however, failed in such a unique and interesting way that it was developed further into a weapon of its own right, channeling plasma energy into a semi-predictable, short range stream of agony. However, users should keep in mind that it doesn't cause demons to ''flinch'', necessitating usage of evasive manouvers like circle-strafing for effective use.";
MC_MetaLightningGun_Desc2 = "Alternate Fire launches an unstable ball of plasma energy that, upon hitting a solid object, blossums into a searing mass of energy that effectively stuns enemies within the blast radius, leaving them easy pickings for other means of attack.";

The prize of the military's arsenal, the BFG 9000 combines everything the UAC knows about weaponized plasma, weaponized Argent Energy, and weaponized pretty-much-everything into one 300-pound package. While it's the most powerful and most effective weapon mankind has ever laid its eyes upon, its sheer size renders it unportable and impossible for one man to wield (well, unless that one man was really, REALLY angry, but what are the odds?)";

Next to nothing is known of it, even as archaeological efforts work to literally dig up the secret history of whoever - or whatever - previously occupied Mars and its moons.

Others believe that whatever power it may have had is long-gone, and consider it a creepy-looking paperweight.";
MC_MetaSoulCube_Desc2 = "Once the Soul Cube is in your possession, enemies may drop orbs of soul energy upon death.

You can refill the device in many fluid sources you may find throughout your journey, up to and including radioactive waste (we do not recommend this course of action, but if you do decide upon it, at least make sure you wear gloves).
